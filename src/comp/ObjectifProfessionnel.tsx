      <h2>Objectif professionnel</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm a first-year student at Mohammadia School of Engineers
        and I'm learning about various CS basics such as development, data
        science, and networking. My goal for this year is to build a strong
        general knowledge. Resourceful and independent in my work, I like to
        spend time solving problems and realize quality code. I am interested in
        technology, coding, and maths. I am working on developing my soft skills
        such as communication, teamwork, and project management.
